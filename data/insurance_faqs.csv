1,What does my auto insurance typically cover?,"Standard auto policies usually include: (a) Liability (bodily injury & property damage) to others; (b) Collision (damage to your car from a collision) subject to deductible; (c) Comprehensive (non-collision events like theft, vandalism, fire, hitting an animal) subject to deductible. Optional add-ons: rental reimbursement, roadside assistance, uninsured motorist. Check your Declarations page for exact coverages.",auto,2025-09-01
2,What is NOT covered by my auto/home policy?,"Typical exclusions: normal wear & tear, mechanical breakdown, intentional damage, racing or illegal acts, damage while using vehicle commercially (without commercial endorsement). Standard home/auto policies also usually exclude flood and earthquake unless you purchase a separate endorsement or policy.",exclusions,2025-09-01
3,What is the claim filing deadline and how soon must I notify you?,"Notify your insurer as soon as possible — ideally immediately after the incident. Many insurers require filing a claim and submitting required documents within 30 days of the loss; some deadlines vary by policy or state. Always report promptly to avoid coverage disputes.",claims,2025-08-15
4,Which documents are required to file a claim?,"Commonly required: policy number, government-issued ID, photos of damage, police report (if applicable), repair estimates, receipts for damaged items, and any other supporting documentation. Keep originals and submit copies with your claim form.",claims_docs,2025-07-20
5,What is a deductible and how does it work?,"A deductible is the out-of-pocket amount you pay when you make a claim (e.g., $500). For collision/comprehensive claims, insurer pays (loss - deductible). Higher deductibles reduce premium; check your Declarations for amounts per coverage.",deductible,2025-06-10
6,Does my policy cover rental car after an accident?,"Rental car reimbursement is NOT automatically included in all policies. If you purchased 'rental reimbursement' or 'loss of use' endorsement, the insurer will pay for a rental (up to the policy limit). Otherwise, you pay out of pocket or use a credit card benefit.",auto_rental,2025-07-12
7,Is roadside assistance included?,"Roadside assistance is usually an optional add-on. If included, it covers services like towing, jump starts, tire changes, lockout assistance and fuel delivery up to policy limits. Confirm if your policy includes it.",roadside,2025-05-25
8,Are personal belongings covered under homeowners?,"Homeowners policies cover personal property for named perils (or all-risk depending on policy) subject to limits and sub-limits (e.g., jewelry). High-value items like jewelry or art often require scheduled endorsements for full coverage.",home_contents,2025-08-01
9,Is flood or earthquake damage covered?,"Standard homeowner and auto policies generally exclude flood and earthquake. These require separate policies or endorsements (e.g., NFIP for flood in the U.S.). Check your policy for specific exclusions and options to purchase separate coverage.",natural_disasters,2025-04-30
10,Will my premium increase after I file a claim?,"Premiums can increase after at-fault claims. Factors: claim size, frequency, your driving history, and insurer policy (some offer one-time 'accident forgiveness'). Small claims may still affect renewal premium depending on insurer rules.",premium_impact,2025-08-01
11,How long does it take to settle a claim?,"Settlement time varies by complexity: simple claims often resolved in 2–4 weeks; complex claims (injuries, liability disputes) can take months. Timely document submission and cooperation speed up processing.",claims_timing,2025-07-01
12,How can I cancel or change my policy?,"You may cancel or modify your policy by contacting your agent or customer service. Cancellation may be effective immediately or after a notice period; refunds may be prorated or short-rated. If your premium lapse occurs, you may lose coverage and face re-instatement fees.",policy_change,2025-06-01
